# Sample_Code
A collection of my code from various points in my career. 

## Undergrad Thesis

2017-2019

The files are prepended with SXX which designates the step in the pipeline. I've
curated the bigger parts of the pipeline that show more complex processes but the
indexing shows how I named and stepped my pipeline. My work mostly involved
running individual scripts or groups of scripts in order but separately and 
checking intermediate results for verification. All documentation at the time was
collected in a separate documentation file. 

Two scripts to note: 

1. S52_heatmaps.R: code used to generate heatmaps for the project

2. S70_up_down_flat_ver2_candidateprots.R: code used to generate matrices
for UpSetR plots.


## Codeathons

These are scripts used in codeathons I've taken part in. 

1. codeathon2_diffExp.R: code used to perform differential expression and down-
stream analyses. 


## Misc Projects

Code used on collaborative projects. 

1. sflompro_extract_common_rows.R: proteomics project

## NIST
